DD-UP client v3.0.1
-------------------

DD-UP is a program that is used to update a host
provided by the Free DynDNS service of dyndns.org.

I did a quick and dirty script to compile the DDUP client under OS/2. Just run
'make.cmd' to build an executable. Remember that you need EMX 0.9d environment
installed to do this.

If you don't have the necessary tools to build the executable, just use the in-
cluded executable (ddup.exe). It'll search only the current directory for the
ddup.conf file though...

Don't forget to run 'ddup --makeconf' to create the configuration file.
